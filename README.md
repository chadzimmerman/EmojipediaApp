# React Emoji Dictionary

This project is a **React-based dictionary for emojis**, designed as a practice project to explore **components**, **modular design**, and **state management**. The app allows users to input emoji definitions and view the corresponding emoji on screen. It’s a simple, yet fun, way to demonstrate the power of React components and how they can interact with each other to create dynamic user interfaces.

## Features

- **React Components**: Organized into modular components for easy maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The app dynamically renders emoji definitions on the screen.
- **Emoji Display**: Displays emojis with their corresponding definitions in an easy-to-read format.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building reusable components and managing state.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used for writing the core functionality.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and ensuring it’s responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for developing React apps.
